내 문장은 아래처럼 수정하는 것이 적절함
```
Actually, I like all the categories in the technological field. 
But most of all, I like automated systems.
```

# 세상은 디지털화 된다
```
It can be > They로 수정
They can make our lives more comfortable and convenient. 

converted > becomes
I hope our world becomes more digitalized.

In the future, automated systems will be everywhere, 
but people might not realize it 
because they will be running automatically by AI.

Before advanced AI, practical applications were operated by humans. 
Now, many tasks are handled by AI.
```

# 디지털 세상이 오면, 필기를 하고 싶다...
```
Actually, this is my personal preference.
I have a special habit: my writing must be perfect and neat. 
If I make a mistake, I erase the entire page because I don't like seeing eraser marks. 
That's why digital writing systems are my favorite.

When I write in my physical notebook with this pen, 
the words are converted into digital vectors 
and can be seen on my computer monitor. 

This allows me to move or erase single words digitally,
which isn't possible with just the physical notebook. 
In the future, I hope to control my physical notebook in this way too.

For real study, I write quickly using an analog pen and paper. 
I take down my lectures and then clarify my lecture notes. 

After clarifying my class lecture notes, I repeat the same course. 
During this clarification step, I use my digital tools.

Repeating the same course can improve my understanding, but it takes a lot of time.
Sometimes it's not useful because not all study material is relevant to my life. 

However, the clarification step helps me focus on the entire lecture, 
even though it's not great for managing my time.
```

# 시간을 어떻게 쓰는지
```
Actually, I love my tech and studying my major. 
It's one of my interests, and I'm very passionate about it. 

My friends are amazed because they don't like their majors as much. 
For me, studying and other activities are the same thing. 
However, I separate time for exercising and meals like lunch and dinner. 
Every day I have breakfast, enjoy dessert and sweet things. 
```

# 어떤 디저트를 좋아하는지
```
I like desserts like drinks or pudding. 
Pudding is a sweet and flexible dessert made with eggs and cream.
Some puddings include chocolate or other sweet flavors like custard or matcha. 
Sometimes they are made with fruits such as grapefruit 
and another fruit called 'jamon' in Korean.

Sure, I like custard pudding the most. 
I have made pudding myself before. 
Sometimes it turns out very well and my family is surprised, asking how I made it. 
But other times, it doesn't turn out so well and I'm not sure why.

Actually, the eggs are important. 
In the best case, the eggs are not too cold 
and the caramel sauce is boiled for just the right amount of time to be perfect. 
In a bad case, if the eggs are too cold or if the caramel sauce is overboiled, it can cause problems.

Actually, if you want perfect custard pudding, I recommend just buying it. 
You can find perfect custard pudding at some cafes. 
I buy them too.
